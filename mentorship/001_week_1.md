# Introduction to Functional Programming

* Expression is a chunk of code that evaluates to a value `7 + 5``
* The value of an expressions can be given a name `const sum`. The expression is evaluated first and the resulting value is assigned to the name.
* By default use `const` keyword. A variable declared with the `const` cannot be re-assigned
* Object can easily be composed together:

```js
const a = 'a'
const oA = {a}
const b = 'b'
const oB = {b}

const c {...oA, ....oB} // c = {a: 'a', b: 'b'}
``` 

**Note:** Those dots are the object spread operators. It iterates over the properties of oA and assigns them to the new object, then does the same for oB,overriding any keys that already exist on the new object. 

> Mutation an object rather than creating a new object is usually a bug. 

* A signature consists of 3 parts:
1. An optional function name
2. A list of parameter types in parenthesis
3. The type of the return value

```ts
// signature dummy
functionName(param1: Type, param2: Type) => Type
// real example
double(x: n) => Number
```

* A function can have default parameter values `const f = (n = 0) => n`

```js
const createUser = ({
	name = 'Anonymous',
  	avatar = '/avatar-face.jpg'
}) => ({
	name,
  	avatar
})

const george = createUser({name: 'George', avatar: 'face.jpg'})
``` 

* Rest and Spread Operators

```js
const aTail = (head, ...tail) => tail
aTail(1, 2, 3) // [2, 3]
``` 

**Note:** Rest gathers individual element into an array. Spread does the opposite!

```js
const shiftToLast = (head, ...tail) => [...tail, head]
shiftToLast(1, 2, 3) // [2, 3, 1]
``` 

> Function composition is central to functional programming.
