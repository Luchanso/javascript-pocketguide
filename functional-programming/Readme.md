# Functional Programming

Things to revisit later:

> Seen through the lens of side-effects, mocks are a flag that your code is impure, and in the functional programmer’s eye, proof that something is wrong. Instead of downloading a library to help us check the iceberg is intact, we should be sailing around it. A hardcore TDD/Java guy once asked me how you do mocking in Clojure. The answer is, we usually don’t. We usually see it as a sign we need to refactor our code. [Source](http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/which-programming-languages-are-functional.html)
